# ValleyOfKings
Basic text-based game as an intro project to game design in C++. There are several C++ coding aspects that are in use to make this happen including inheritance, static pointers, classes, and more mundane things like vector manipulation and loops. All inclusions have been from the standard library.

## Next Steps - Version 2.0
###### Version 1.0
Version 1.0 was developed as a final project for ME 273, and included a cast of characters and monsters that varied in stats based on the difficulty level selected. The entire game consisted of a single encounter between the two groups, with everyone only have access to basic attacks.
###### Version 2.0
**CURRENTLY VERSION 2.0 IS NOT UNDER DEVELOPMENT**
The Idea of Version 2.0 is to have 3-4 sets of levels with 2-3 encounters each. During each level the player would learn more about the characters through their flavor text, and the environment through exploration. As the player succeeds in missions they will gain experience points they can spend on unit upgrades for more powerful moves. Additionally, as they successfully raid tombs, they will gain gold that can be spent at a market for exotic weapons and utility items. However the user should be careful, given that the characters are professional grave robbers gold is also victory points that will be tallied at the end of the game. 
There will be several different enemy type, each with different hit point values, attack values, and some with special abilities. Each level set will have a boss that requires some concerted effort to take down, but correspondingly yields significant treasure and a unique weapon. 
###### Version 3.0 and Beyond
In future versions there is a plan to include music support and pixel graphics.

## Version Format
Versions will follow the following format: release number.feature number.bugfix number (ex. 1.3.20). Release number refers to the number of full releases that the game has had. As an example, release 1.0 was a proof of concept with a single combat encounter of varying difficulty depending on what the user selected. The feature number is the number of features that have been created between releases. This can also refer to the number of major changes to the code, such as an addition of a backend class or a new set of graphics. Finally, the bugfix number is the number of major bugfix 'sessions' that have be released. Because bugfixes will not really happen until after a major release this number might only rarely be incremented. 

## Installation
I am honestly not entirely sure how to do so. The best option may be to download the code and compile it on your IDE of choice.
